Well, this is my first post after a long time with this GitHub page.

Here I will post some of my experiences as a developer in any company that I've worked or currently working in a easy and simplified way.

The language that I would write things here is Portuguese, but to make accessible to anyone to read easily the content and to force me to practice the language, I chose the English language, so if you notice any grammar error, sorry since now.

I really don't know if anyone will open the posts and read, but if you do I hope that I helped you somehow.

Also the content may have some changes after been posted if I think that can be necessary.
