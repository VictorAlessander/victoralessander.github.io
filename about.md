Currently I'm working on Conductor Tecnologia as a Mid Analyst Developer, fixing production bugs.
This company is a credit card processor and creates solutions to others companies to make more easier and technologic payment methods.

In my free times I like to play drums, watch TV shows and work in my personal projects.
